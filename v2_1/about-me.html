    <p id="about_me">
        Hello, My name is Christopher Eaton, I am 33 years old and currently reside in Westminster, Ca. I have been
        married for 12 years to Sarah and we have two beautiful daughters; Harlow, who is 5, and Theodora, who is 2.
        I currently work at Costco Wholesale in Huntington Beach, Ca in the Tire Center as a tire installer/salesman
        but also acted as a lead whenever needed. I am also enrolled in a web development boot camp known as
        "LearningFuze". I hope to become proficient enough and gain the expertise and knowledge to work as a well
        sought after web developer. It is important for me to accomplish this, not just to get a well paying job to
        support my family, but also to be in a sector that is only going to get more interesting and encompassing.
    </p>
