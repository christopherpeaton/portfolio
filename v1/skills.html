    <h2>Skills</h2>

    <p><b>Greater Computer Knowledge</b> - I want to be more knowledgeable about computers, in general.  I want to be
        more proficient in how they work, both inside and out on both hardware and software sides.
    </p>

    <p><b>Master Code Decipher-er</b> - Being able to read code is another skill I want to possess.  To be able to
        look at code and determine whether or not is is "good" or "bad", what they are trying to do with it
        and ways to make it better.
    </p>

    <p><b>Super Coder</b> - I want to be the best coder I can be.  To be well rounded, knowledgeable and proficient.
        I want to be able to make websites, applications, games and anything else that involves computer coding.
        I want it all!
    </p>

    <p><b>Finger on the technology pulse</b> - To be good in the technology industry one must be on the cusp of the
        technology industry.  To go to seminars, webinars, conventions.  Getting out there and being in the middle of
        it all.  By the end of this class, I hope to have a good idea of what to look for in these and where to look
        to find them so I can keep up.</p>

    <p><b>Network of Peers</b> - After this class, I hope to have a large (at least larger than it is now) network of
        friends and aquaintences to not only exchange information with, but to also build relationships on.  To have
        people to ask for a review or go get dinner.  A network of friends.</p>
